This program functions as expected. Using the insert function in graph.cpp, it makes a graph out of the list of movies and actors.
Then using BFS, it searches for coactors and prints the links if present or else prints not present.
I got help from geeks for geeks, the TAs, and my friend Ritwik from SJSU, who helped me design and develop the sixdegress.cpp file.

Used this to learn about for each in c++, for all this time I thought it was only in Python smhh
